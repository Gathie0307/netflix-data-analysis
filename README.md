# Netflix Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores Netflix's dataset to generate insights and build a machine learning model. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling using Python libraries such as `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

3. How has content production changed over the years?
4. Are certain ratings more common for movies than TV shows?
5. Which genres dominate Netflix's catalog?

## Hypotheses
1. The majority of Netflix content is movies.
2. The United States produces the largest amount of Netflix content.
3. Netflix has released more content in recent years compared to earlier years.

## Data Cleaning
1. Dropped duplicates to ensure each record is unique.
2. Filled missing values in categorical columns (`director`, `cast`, `country`, `rating`) using the mode.
3. Standardized text columns with stripped whitespace and capitalized titles/countries.
4. Converted rating into numeric codes using .astype('category').cat.codes.
5. Changed date_added into a datetime format.
